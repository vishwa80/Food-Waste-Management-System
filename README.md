# Food-Waste-Management-System
The project aims to reduce local food wastage by creating a centralized digital platform that connects  food providers (restaurants, grocery stores, supermarkets, etc.) with receivers (NGOs, shelters, needy individuals).  It enables real-time food listing, claiming, and tracking, ensuring surplus food reaches those who need it instead .
